    </h1>

    <p>
        I am an <b>international student</b> from Hong Kong, and I came to the United States at the age of 14, alone, for high school in New York. I was nervous and excited to take on a new educational opportunity abroad. After two years of attending two different high schools, I discovered an opportunity which I skipped the twelfth grade and enrolled in community college at the age of 16. Eventually, I made it to my dream school <i>UCLA</i>, where I am now already a graduating senior, majoring in <b>Mathematics/ Economics</b> and minoring in <b>Digital Humanities</b>. My past experiences greatly shaped who I am today and I am grateful to have fully utilized this international student experience.

        During my last quarter at UCLA, I really hope to gain as much hands-on experience and skills as I can to be ready for my future, which I believe can be achieved by taking this course- we will be learning various different technologies such as <i>GitHub, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Leaflet</i>. Moreover, this will be a perfect opportunity to dive into topics that particularly interests me and work on meaningful projects!
