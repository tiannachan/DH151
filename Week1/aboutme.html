        Hi everyone, I am Tianna! I am an international student from Hong Kong,
        and I came to the United States at the age of 14, alone, for high school in New
        York. I was nervous and excited to take on a new educational opportunity abroad.
        After two years of attending two different high schools, I discovered an
        opportunity which I skipped the twelfth grade and enrolled in community college
        at the age of 16. Eventually, I made it to my dream school UCLA, where I
        am now already a graduating senior, majoring in <b>Mathematics/ Economics</b>
        and minoring in <b>Digital Humanities</b>. My past experiences greatly shaped
        who I am today and I am grateful to have fully utilized this international
        student experience.

        <i>Goals for this course:</i> <br><br>
        During my last quarter at UCLA, I really hope to gain as much hands-on
        experience and skills as I can to be ready for my future, which I believe can be
        achieved by taking this course- we will be learning various different
        technologies such as <i>GitHub, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Leaflet</i>.
        Moreover, this will be a perfect opportunity to dive into topics that
        particularly interests me and work on meaningful projects.
